Hi! I am a second-year PhD student at UCSD, advised by <a
  href=https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/>Kamalika Chaudhuri</a>.
My research is on extending the frontiers of differential privacy by making it
more efficient and easier to implement. I am broadly interested in
the machine learning subfields of fairness and privacy, formal logic, and
topics in discrete mathematics and statistics.

  Outside of work, I try to maintain a healthy spirit and body. I do this by being 
  physically active as much as possible, cooking a lot of food for myself,
  meditating and practicing yoga, reading books, and spending time outside.

  If any of this webpage is interesting to you, I would be flattered if you
  could follow me on Twitter.
